    "Mode: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. It is not always applicable, as there may be more than one mode or no mode at all. The mode is often used to describe the shape of a distribution, especially in cases where the data is not normally distributed."

However, it does not take into account the variability of the values between the largest and smallest values, so it may not be a good measure of dispersion for datasets with outliers or extreme values.\n",

The variance is the average of the squared differences between each value and the mean of the dataset, while the standard deviation is the square root of the variance. The standard deviation is often preferred over the variance because it is expressed in the same units as the original data.\n",

The standard deviation is approximately 10.67, which tells us that the scores are on average about 10.67 points away from the mean.\n",

    "The mean is sensitive to outliers because it is calculated by taking the sum of all values and dividing by the number of values. If there are extreme values in the dataset, the mean can be pulled towards them, resulting in a skewed representation of the typical values. For example, consider a dataset of test scores: 60, 70, 80, 85, 90, 95, and 100. The mean score is 82.9. However, if there was an outlier score of 50, the mean would be pulled down to 76.4, which would not accurately reflect the typical performance of the group.\n",

    "The standard deviation is also affected by outliers because it is based on the distance of each data point from the mean. Outliers can increase the distance of the mean from the rest of the data points, resulting in a larger standard deviation. For example, consider a dataset of salaries: $50,000, $55,000, $60,000, $65,000, $70,000, $75,000, and $1,000,000. The mean salary is $197,143, and the standard deviation is $359,781.
